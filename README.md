The goal of this project is to help me grow my knowledge of web browsers and how they are engineered. This is facilitated by creating my browser using Python. My browser will initially start as a very simple browser. It will be able to take the URL to receive some data, parse the body, and return the information. There will be more to include over time as my knowledge grows.
This project follows the lessons in this digital book https://browser.engineering/.
