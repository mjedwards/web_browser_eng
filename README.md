The goal of this project is to help me grow my knowledge of web browsers and how they are engineered. This is facilitated by creating my own browser using python. My browser will initially
start off as a very simple browser. It will be able to take url receive some data, parse the body, and return the information. There will be more to include overtime as my knowledge grows. 

This project follows the lessons in this digital book https://browser.engineering/.
